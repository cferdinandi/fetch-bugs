# Fetch Issues

Thanks for using [Fetch](http://fetch.gomakethings.com/). If you have a question or want to report a bug, you're in the right place.



## Reporting a bug

First, **make sure the bug hasn't already been reported** by [searching the issues section](https://github.com/cferdinandi/fetch/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue).

If no existing issue exists, go ahead and create one. **Please be sure to include all of the following:**

1. A clear, descriptive title (ie. "A bug" is *not* a good title).
2. If possible, [a reduced test case](https://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/).
3. The browser and operating system that you're using.



## Asking a question

Before asking, please **make sure the question hasn't already been asked** by [searching the issues section](https://github.com/cferdinandi/fetch/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue).
